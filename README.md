## Knights Travails
This is a script that takes an inital state and a goal state on a chess board and returns the shortest path a knight can
take to go from the initial state to the goal state.

This is structured as a graph problem, where each node represents a position on a chess board. Using BFS, the script
is able to traverse the graph and find the shortest path to the terminal state.
